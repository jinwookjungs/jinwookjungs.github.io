### **Short Biography**
**Jinwook Jung** received the B.E. degree in computer and systems engineering from Kobe University, Japan, in 2011. 
He was a recipient of Korea-Japan Joint Government Scholarship Program for Students in Science and Engineering Departments, one of the most prestigious scholarship programs in Korea, which includes an exemption to tuition fees as well as living expenses for 5 years (about USD 110k in total). 
He received the M.E. degree (graduation with honors) in system informatics at the same university, in 2013.
Jinwook subsequently came back to Korea and joined Prof. Youngsoo Shin’s research group in EE department at KAIST, where he is currently a Ph.D. candidate. 
His current research interests include VLSI physical design, design for manufacturability, and design automation of genetic/DNA circuits.
